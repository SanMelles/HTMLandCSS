        <b><i>Ranuculus asiaticus (Persian Buttercup)</i></b>

    <h2>Tulip</h2>
    <p>
        Tulips are spring-blooming perennial   (having bulbs as storage organs) in the <b><i>Tulipa</i></b>
        genus. Their flowers are usually large, showy, and brightly coloured, generally red, orange, pink, yellow, or white
        (usually in warm colours). They often have a different coloured blotch at the base of the tepals (petals and sepals,
        collectively), internally. Because of a degree of variability within the populations and a long history of cultivation,
        classification has been complex and controversial. The tulip is a member of the lily family, Liliaceae, along with 14
        other genera, where it is most closely related to Amana, Erythronium, and Gagea in the tribe Lilieae.
